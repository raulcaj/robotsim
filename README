This 'robotsim' is an implementation of robots.txt specification for the code test.
It's written in Java as a standard Java application.
It reads from stdin and writes to stdout, except for malformed PLACE commands where it
sends an error message to stderr.


As you can see there are three directories within this one.
\bin		this contains a binary (jar) file
\project	this contains a eclipse mars project
\tests		this contains test data


I tried to keep it simple so I came with the following design:

	Program (class)
		Simulator (class)
			Robot (class)
		Direction (enum)
		Side (enum)

Program is the class that has the entry point for the application.
It is also responsible for:
	Initialization of a Simulator
	Reading the STDIN and feeding it to the simulator

Simulator is a kind of clue class. It's maps the string commands to
methods call.

Robot controls what we would call the business logic of the application.
Most of the test specification is implemented here.

Direction and Side are enums that model the types of problem domain.

There is an additional class Reference<T> which I used as a utility class
for handling the fact that Java has no mechanism for referencing primitive types.

I didn't use javadocs but there're comments on the most complex parts of the code.

I didn't use something like JUnit because I'm not used to use it, but I understand that using it maybe a
good idea for lots of projects.

This is not the greatest piece of code I ever wrote, but it's a fair one.
I spent something like 5 hours from setting up the project, understanding and creating the solution and
writing these instructions. I think it's the average code I would write in a limited time frame like this.
That way I think you can have a realistic view of what I'm capable of.
